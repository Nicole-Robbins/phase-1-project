# Task Helper App

## About the app

- A sorting system to help manage daily tasks.

## The Goal

Managing tasks can be daunting, especially when it seems like it's an endless list of impossible to-dos. The goal of the Task Helper App is to sort daily tasks into three categories based on how much time they are estimated to take. The three categories of "quick-ticks", "Tasks", and "Projects" are designed to optimize your time management to help you "break-up" with the lengthy, stressful to-do list. 

## What are the secret ingredients?

The Task Help App is an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that interacts with a db.json file using a json-server that contains a list of common daily household tasks.

### How to use the app

To use the Task Helper App, select a task from the dropdown list to add to your daily task categories. Use the categories to make sure you're fitting each task into your schedule as realistically and optimally as possible. If you only have 5 minutes right now, knock-out a "quick-tick" and save the Projects for when you have more free time.
