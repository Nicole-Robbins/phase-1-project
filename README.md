# Task Helper App

## About the app

- A sorting system to help manage daily tasks.

## The Goal

Managing tasks can be daunting, especially when it seems like it's an endless list of impossible to-dos. The goal of the Task Helper App is to sort daily tasks into three categories based on how much time they are estimated to take. The three categories of "quick-ticks", "Tasks", and "Projects" are designed to optimize your time management to help you "break-up" with the lengthy, stressful to-do list. 

## What are the secret ingredients?

The Task Help App is an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that interacts with a db.json file using a json-server that contains a list of common daily household tasks.

### How to use the app

To use the Task Helper App, select a task from the dropdown list to add to your daily task categories. The task will appear in either the category "quick-ticks" which take 5 minutes or less, "tasks" which take between 5-15 minutes, or "Projects" which take 15 minutes or more. To delete a task, simply click the "x" button.

 Use the categories to make sure you're fitting each task into your schedule as realistically and optimally as possible. If you only have 5 minutes right now, knock-out a "quick-tick" and save the Projects for when you have more free time.
