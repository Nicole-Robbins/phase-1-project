# Task Helper App

## About the app

- A sorting system to help manage daily tasks.

## The Goal

Managing tasks can be daunting, especially when it seems like it's an endless list of impossible to-dos. The goal of the Task Helper App is to sort daily tasks into three categories based on how much time they are estimated to take. The three categories of "quick-ticks", "Tasks", and "Projects" are designed to optimize your time management to help you "break-up" with the lengthy, stressful to-do list. 

### What are the secret ingredients?

The Task Help App is an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that interacts with a db.json file using a json-server.
